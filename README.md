# SQUIRREL
SQL Query Util-Izing Rust's Reliable and Efficient Logic

---

## About
This is a SQL database written in Rust. It will be based off of (and hopefully be made wire-compatible with) PostgreSQL's syntax.

## Feature roadmap

[ ] Table creation via CREATE with varchar & integer datatype

[ ] SELECT * query 

[ ] SELECT (filtered columns) query 

[ ] Primary Keys via B+ Tree

[ ] Foreign Keys

[ ] Some form of JOINs

[ ] Support [Postgres' messaging system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#id-1.10.6.7.3) (wire compatability)
 
... other stuff is TBD
